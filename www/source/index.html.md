A high performance, asynchronous Java client to query the Orchestrate.io service.

The client uses the [Grizzly framework](https://grizzly.java.net/) for
 processing HTTP requests and [Jackson JSON parser](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome)
 for marshalling data to and from the [Orchestrate.io](http://orchestrate.io/)
 service.

## <a name="about"></a> About Orchestrate

The [Orchestrate.io](http://orchestrate.io/) service is a platform for storing
 and querying data.

We've designed the platform around the promise of removing the burden of managing
 multiple databases, handling the uptime of those systems and ensuring that
 your applications are still able to read and write data in the event of a
 "flash crowd" (a dramatically increase in traffic that requires the data system
 to scale rapidly to cope with the increase demand on resources).

Using Orchestrate.io you can focus on building applications and adding new
 features while we handle safely storing the data, providing a large variety of
 ways to query the data and keeping the service highly available to support your
 applications as they grow.

### Creating an account

You can create an account by signing up at our
 [Dashboard](https://dashboard.orchestrate.io/).

## <a name="getting-started"></a> Getting Started

Once you've created an account with the Orchestrate.io Dashboard you're ready to
 build an application with the Java client.

All operations to the Orchestrate.io service happen in the context of an
 `Application` and you can create one from the Dashboard. An `Application` can
 contain any number of `Collection`s. A `Collection` is a namespace for data of
 the same type, in exactly the same way as a table in a `SQL` database.

For example, if you were building a social network, you might have a single
 application named “MyPlace”. The application would then have multiple collections
 within it, based on the different types/groups of information you are storing.
 There might be collections named "users", "pages" and "games".

When first setting up your application, you will need to create it via the
 [Dashboard](https://dashboard.orchestrate.io/). This creation process will
 generate an API key which the Java client uses to access the data in the
 application. Note that while the `Application` must be created manually, it's
 not necessary to create Collections up front — collections are created
 automatically on the first write.

To start reading and writing data to your application, have a look at
 [Querying](/querying.html)

For more information check out the [Getting Started](https://dashboard.orchestrate.io/getting_started)
 section in the Dashboard.
